    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This chilaquiles breakfast casserole is made with layered tortilla chips, baked in a spiced chile sauce and cheese. Topped with fried or poached eggs, and plenty of delicious fixings, it's very satisfying. Traditional chilaquiles are made in a skillet, but this casserole version is a great way to serve a large group at breakfast or a brunch.</p>
